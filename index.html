    <h1 id = "home_h1">Computer software</h1>
    <p id = "first_p">An outline ( algorithm ) of what would have been the first software was written by Ada Lovelace in the 19th century for a planned analytical engine . However, neither a complete analytical engine nor the software for it was ever developed . [1] The first theory of software (before the creation of today's computers) was proposed by Alan Turing in his essay published in 1936. [2] This eventually led to the twin academic fields of computer science and software engineering , which both study software and its creation. Computer science is more theoretical (Turing's essay is an example of computer science), while software engineering focuses on more practical issues.</p>

            <h2>Programming tools</h2>
            <p>A development tool is also software in the form of programs or web applications that software developers (also called programmers or software engineers) use to create, debug, maintain (i.e. improve, or fix). Software is written in one or more programming languages. Many programming languages ​​exist, and each has at least one implementation , each consisting of its own set of development tools.</p>

            <h2>Execution</h2>
            <p>Computer software must be "loaded" into the computer's memory (e.g., hard drive or memory). This process involves passing instructions from the application software, through the system software , to the hardware, which ultimately receives the instruction as machine code . Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation by moving data, performing a calculation, or changing the control of the instructions.</p>
